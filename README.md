### Predicting Text Difficulty
This projects shows an attempt to create a model that would predict text difficulty in a statement or sentence with high accuracy. For each statement or sentence, the model would predict whether it needs to be simplified or not simplified. This could potentially help build a tool that could aid editors, who simplify text and increase its readability of wikipedia pages for those who have learning/reading difficulties or have English as a second language.

- models_run.py 
- eval_model.py
- EDA_FeatureSelection_Evaluation.ipynb

### Preparation
The code requires pandas, numpy, spacy, scikit-learn, matplotlib and re to run.
